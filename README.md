# CourseCounselorChatbot
Prolog based AI Chatbot Assignment

The course counselor chatbot is part of my artificial intelligence course assignment. 
The chatbot is designed to handle basic use case scenarios like: 
1.	Eligibility criteria – interact with the student to ask about his/her education and grades to tell him for what branches he/she is eligible.
2.	Application process – answer questions about deadline, exam date, exam centres, special instructions, syllabus, types of question asked, scholarship etc.
3.	Application status – tell about score of the student, different cut-offs, seat allocated to him/her.
4.	Admission – answer about fees structure, payment details, payment status and confirmations etc.

The chatbot runs on swipl-windows . It is not tested on any other platforms/compilers.
